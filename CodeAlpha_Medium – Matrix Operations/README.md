# Task Overview

The task involves developing a structured computer program to perform essential linear algebra operations: Matrix Addition, Matrix Multiplication, and Matrix Transposition. The core objective is to move beyond simple sequential coding by implementing modularity. This is achieved by creating distinct functions for each operation (e.g., addMatrices, multiplyMatrices), ensuring the code is reusable, organized, and easier to debug. The data handling relies on 2D arrays, which mimic the row-and-column structure of mathematical matrices.

## *Tools and Concepts Used*:-

●	Programming Language: The solution is implemented in C, a foundational language ideal for understanding memory management and array manipulation.

●	Data Structures: 2D Arrays (e.g., int matrix[rows][cols]) are used to store grid data.

●	Control Structures: Nested for loops are the primary tool for iterating through rows and columns to compute sums or products.

●	Standard Libraries: <stdio.h> is essential for handling input/output operations, while <stdlib.h> may be used if dynamic memory allocation is introduced.

## *Editor Platform*:-

This code can be developed on various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) or text editors depending on the user's setup:

●	Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A popular, lightweight editor with C/C++ extensions for syntax highlighting and debugging.

●	Code::Blocks or Dev-C++: Traditional IDEs often used in academic settings for their simple setup.

●	Online Compilers: Platforms like Replit or Programiz allow for quick testing without local installation.

●	Compiler: A standard GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang compiler is required to translate the C code into an executable.

## *Applicability and Real-World Use*:-

While this specific task is an academic exercise, the underlying concepts are critical in modern computing.

●	Computer Graphics: Matrix multiplication is the engine behind 3D rendering, handling rotation, scaling, and translation of objects in video games and simulations.

●	Machine Learning: Neural networks rely heavily on matrix operations (linear algebra) to process vast datasets and adjust weights during training.

●	Scientific Computing: Solving systems of linear equations in physics and engineering often requires the same matrix algorithms implemented here.
